=== FACILITY MAINTENANCE LOG ===
September 2157

2157-09-01
Routine inspection of silo complex.
- Missile systems: NOMINAL
- Targeting computers: NOMINAL
- Launch authorization: AWAITING COMMAND
All systems green.

2157-09-02
Performed pressure check on coolant systems.
All readings within parameters.

Noticed increased chatter on military frequencies.
Something's happening up north.

2157-09-03 [MORNING]
Commander Davis ordered full systems check.
Everything operational.

He asked me if the missiles could be reprogrammed.
I said technically yes, but why would we?
He didn't answer.

2157-09-03 [AFTERNOON - FINAL ENTRY]
It's over.

The entire world just burned.

We're sealing the facility. Commander Davis says we need
to preserve these weapons as a deterrent, even if there's
no one left to deter.

I think he's just afraid of making that final decision -
the decision to disarm forever.

For emergency access to this facility, final authorization code:
TANGO-4456

May whoever finds this have the wisdom to use it responsibly.
Or better yet, may you never need to use it at all.

Chief Engineer Morrison
