=== PERSONAL LETTER ===
Found in Commander Davis' personal safe
Written: 2157-09-03 18:00 UTC
Never sent.

Dear Sarah, Emily, and little Jessica,

I'm writing this even though I know you'll never read it.
The satellites are gone. The world is gone. You are gone.

I watched it happen on the screens. Boston was one of 
the first cities. I hope it was quick. I hope you didn't suffer.

Emily, you asked me why I had to work at the South Pole.
I told you it was important for science, for peace.

The truth is, I was stationed here because of the missiles
buried beneath the ice. I was part of the system that ended 
the world. I guarded the Doomsday weapons "just in case."

And now the case has come.

Jessica, you're only 4 years old. Were. You were only 4.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday. I'm sorry I missed everything.

Sarah, I love you. I always have. I'm sorry our last conversation
was an argument about me missing Christmas again.

I'm sealing this letter in my safe. Maybe in a hundred years,
someone will find it. Maybe they'll know that we loved.
That we tried. That we failed.

I'm going outside now. The radiation is rising, but I don't care.
I want to see the stars one more time.

I love you all.

David
