RE: Global Catastrophe - Survival Protocol

SITUATION SUMMARY:
As of 2157-09-03 14:23 UTC, global nuclear exchange has occurred.
All major population centers appear destroyed.
Northern hemisphere is uninhabitable.

CONFIRMED STATIONS STILL RESPONDING:
- McMurdo Station (US): ONLINE
- Vostok Station (RU): ONLINE
- Amundsen-Scott Station (US): ONLINE
- Concordia Station (FR/IT): ONLINE

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Seal all facilities against radiation
2. Activate long-term life support systems
3. Preserve all research data
4. Maintain communication protocols

LONG-TERM SURVIVAL:
We estimate 6-18 months before radiation reaches lethal levels
even at Antarctic latitudes. All personnel should prepare for
extended isolation.

FINAL DIRECTIVE:
If you are reading this in the future, know that we tried.
We documented everything. We preserved what we could.
The data is here. Use it wisely.

Dr. Jean-Pierre Laurent
Station Commander
Concordia Station
