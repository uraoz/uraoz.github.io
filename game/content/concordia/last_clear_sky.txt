=== ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATION LOG ===
Concordia Station Observatory

FINAL ENTRY:

17:45 UTC
The ash cloud is spreading faster than atmospheric models predicted.
In approximately 3 hours, it will reach southern latitudes.

This will be the last clear view of the cosmos for decades.
Perhaps for centuries.

I'm documenting the visible stars while I still can.

Visible constellations (Southern Hemisphere):
- Crux (Southern Cross): Clear
- Centaurus: Clear
- Carina: Clear
- Vela: Obscured by ash (15%)

Polaris: Not visible from Antarctica

PERSONAL REFLECTION:

I became an astronomer because I wanted to understand the universe.
I wanted to know our place in the cosmic story.

Now I know.

We are the species that burned its own cradle.
We are the intelligence that chose extinction.

I hope something survives us.
I hope a second chance.
