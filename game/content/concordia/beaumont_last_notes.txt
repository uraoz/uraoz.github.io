=== DR. BEAUMONT'S LAST NOTES ===
Personal Log - Dr. Marie Beaumont
Concordia Station

2157-09-05
The radiation readings are climbing faster than predicted.
We sealed the station, but it won't matter in the long run.

Laurent estimates we have 8 months, maybe a year.
I think he's being optimistic.

2157-09-12
The sky is completely dark now. Polar summer, but you
wouldn't know it. The ash cloud has reached us.

Temperature dropping rapidly. Nuclear winter has begun.

2157-09-20
We're down to 12 people. Three died from radiation sickness.
The rest of us are showing symptoms.

I've been documenting everything. Someone needs to know
what happened here. What we saw. What we lost.

2157-10-01
Only 5 of us left now. Three more died overnight.
I'm the senior scientist after Laurent, not that it means anything anymore.

We've automated everything we can. The systems will
run for decades after we're gone.

2157-10-08
Laurent died this morning. The radiation got to him first -
he spent more time outside during the initial evacuation procedures.

I'm the only one left now who can still think clearly.
The others are in the medical bay. Nosebleeds. Fatigue. Hair loss.

I know what comes next.

2157-10-14
I'm alone now.

The others are in the medical bay. I sealed it.
I couldn't watch anymore.

I'm uploading all our data to the network core.
If anyone ever finds this, you'll know what happened.

You'll know we were here.
You'll know we tried to survive.
You'll know we failed.

2157-10-18
This is my final entry.

The radiation is too much now. I can barely type.

To whoever finds this: We were scientists. We were explorers.
We were human beings who loved this world.

Remember us.
