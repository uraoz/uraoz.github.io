BIOLOGICAL ANOMALY REPORT #BIO-992
Dr. Anna Kovacs, Chief Biologist
Date: 2157-09-02 15:30 UTC

SUBJECT: Unknown organism from Vostok ice core sample #774

OBSERVATION:
- Sample origin: 3,769 meters depth, estimated age 15 million years
- Cellular structure: Unlike any terrestrial organism on record
- Temperature tolerance: Rapid cell division observed even at -50°C
- Behavioral anomaly: Samples in separate containers show coordinated
  movement patterns. Possible chemical signaling across isolation barriers.
- Neural network formation: Electron microscopy confirms synaptic-like
  structures forming between separated tissue samples.

INTELLIGENCE INDICATORS:
- Pattern recognition: POSITIVE (responds to light patterns)
- Adaptive behavior: POSITIVE (learns from repeated stimuli)
- Social coordination: EMERGENT (multiple samples act as single entity)
- Threat assessment: INCONCLUSIVE but CONCERNING

RECOMMENDATION:
Immediate quarantine of Sector 4 laboratory.
Request classification review from Project Lazarus oversight team.
Cross-reference with Vostok Station's cryptobiology research.

URGENCY: HIGH
