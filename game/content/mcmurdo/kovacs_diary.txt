=== DR. ANNA KOVACS - PERSONAL LOG ===

2157-08-20
Today was routine. Beat Rossi at chess again. He claims I'm cheating.
Weather is stable (-45°C, winds 15 knots). Supply drop on schedule.

Chen made Italian food tonight. Miller complained about the pasta
being overcooked. Typical Miller.

Tomorrow: Continue cephalopod neural mapping experiments.

2157-08-28
Miller is worried about the northern comm delays. I told him it's
probably just solar activity. Nothing to worry about.

The research is going well. The samples from Vostok are fascinating.
I never thought I'd see this level of neural plasticity in cephalopods.

2157-09-01
The supply drop didn't arrive. Miller filed a complaint with
Christchurch logistics. Still, we have 6 months of reserves.
No cause for alarm.

Noticed something odd: The northern news feeds have been silent
for two days. No updates from CNN, BBC, nothing. Probably just
a network issue.

The sky looks strange today. Reddish hue on the horizon.
Chen says it's atmospheric dust. I'm not convinced.

Tried to call my sister in Boston. Line is dead.
Tried New York. Dead.
Tried London. Dead.

Miller is calling an emergency meeting.

2157-09-03 [AFTERNOON - 14:40 UTC]
The sky is red. The sky is red. The sky is red. The sky is red.
The sky is red. The sky is red. Communications down. The sky is
red. The sky is red. Why is the sky red. The sky is red.
Concordia says they saw it happen. They saw it. All of it.
The sky is red. The sky is red.
