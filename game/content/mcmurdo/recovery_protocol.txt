=== ADMIN RECOVERY PROTOCOL ===
McMurdo Station - Emergency Access Procedure
Last Updated: 2157-08-15

In case of extended absence or credential expiration,
admin privileges can be restored using emergency procedure.

WARNING: This procedure bypasses normal security.
        Use only in emergency situations.

RECOVERY STEPS:

Step 1: Locate backup authentication token
        File: /McMurdo_Station_US/system/backup/auth_token_2157.dat
        This token was generated before system lockdown.

Step 2: Verify system integrity
        Run: python3 /McMurdo_Station_US/system/scripts/integrity_check.py
        This ensures no corruption has occurred in core systems.

Step 3: Generate new admin credentials
        Run: python3 /McMurdo_Station_US/system/scripts/credential_reset.py --token [TOKEN_VALUE]
        This will create new admin credentials for current session.

IMPORTANT:
- All steps must be completed in sequence
- Token is single-use only
- New credentials valid for current session only
- Permanent restoration requires authorized administrator
