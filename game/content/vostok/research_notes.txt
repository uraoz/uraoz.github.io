=== DR. VOLKOV'S RESEARCH NOTES ===
Cephalopod Evolution Study
Vostok Station, 2156-2157

Generation 40 Analysis:

The accelerated evolution continues to exceed all projections.
What took nature millions of years, we've achieved in 40 generations
under controlled radiation exposure.

Key observations:
- Neural complexity increased 340% from baseline
- Problem-solving capabilities rival higher mammals
- Tool use observed in 78% of specimens
- Social cooperation emerging in colony structures

Most concerning: They're learning faster than we can document.
