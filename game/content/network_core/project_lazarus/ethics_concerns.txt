ETHICS COMMITTEE REVIEW - PROJECT LAZARUS
CONFIDENTIAL - INTERNAL USE ONLY
Date: 2156-11-28

COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESENT
Dr. Elizabeth Harrison (Chair, Bioethics)
Dr. Yuki Tanaka (Philosophy of Mind)
Rabbi David Goldstein (Theological Consultant)
Dr. Maria Santos (Medical Ethics)
Colonel Patricia Moore (Military Ethics)

PRIMARY ETHICAL CONCERNS

1. IDENTITY AND CONTINUITY
Is a digital copy the same person or a new entity?
- The upload creates a copy, original consciousness dies
- No continuity of experience proven
- Copy may believe it is original
- Legal status: Are they human? Do they have rights?

Dr. Tanaka: "We are creating philosophical zombies who believe they are real."

2. CONSENT PARADOX
Can one consent to something one cannot truly understand?
- Subjects cannot experience digital existence before agreeing
- Informed consent impossible by definition
- Permanent, irreversible decision
- Consent from original ≠ consent from copy

Rabbi Goldstein: "The soul cannot be digitized. This is an abomination."

3. SUFFERING POTENTIAL
Failed uploads may experience incomprehensible suffering
- Fragmented consciousness
- Eternal isolation
- Inability to die
- No tested termination protocols

Dr. Santos: "First, do no harm. This violates everything."

4. MILITARY APPLICATIONS
Inevitable weaponization of consciousness
- Interrogation of uploads
- Consciousness slavery
- Multiple copies for expendable operations
- Mental modification without consent

Colonel Moore: "Once we open this door, there's no closing it."

OVERRIDE MEMORANDUM
From: Secretary of Defense Reynolds
To: Ethics Committee
Re: Project Lazarus

Your concerns are noted. Given intelligence indicating 97% probability of nuclear exchange within 36 months, consciousness preservation is now a matter of species survival. 

Project continues under Executive Order 13999.

Your objections will be preserved for historical record.

FINAL STATEMENT - Dr. Harrison
"We are not gods. We should not play at being gods. This project represents humanity's hubris at its worst. When we fail - and we will fail - the suffering we create will be unlike anything in human history.

May our successors forgive us.
May our victims forgive us.
May God forgive us.

We won't forgive ourselves."
