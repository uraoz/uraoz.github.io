CONSCIOUSNESS DIGITIZATION PROTOCOL

1. NEURAL MAPPING
- Quantum interferometry scanner resolution: 0.5nm
- Scan time: 47 hours per subject
- Data volume: 4-6TB per consciousness
- Synaptic connection map: ~86 trillion connections
- Neurotransmitter state capture: 12 major types
- Glial cell interaction patterns included

2. MEMORY ENCODING
- Episodic memory: Temporal lobe extraction
- Semantic memory: Distributed network mapping  
- Procedural memory: Cerebellar patterns
- Working memory: Prefrontal snapshot
- Emotional memory: Amygdala-hippocampus loops
- Memory compression: Lossy algorithm (97% retention)

3. CONSCIOUSNESS KERNEL
- Core self-model: 1.2GB recursive structure
- Metacognition engine: Mirror neuron simulation
- Attention management: Thalamic gating reproduction
- Sensory simulation: Phantom input generators
- Time perception: Artificial circadian rhythms

4. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
- Quantum processors: Minimum 2000 qubits
- RAM: 512TB minimum
- Storage: 50PB per consciousness (includes backups)
- Power: 15MW continuous per active consciousness
- Cooling: Liquid helium at 4K

5. KNOWN ISSUES

5.1 The Bootstrap Problem
Consciousness must recognize itself to be conscious.
Digital consciousness may fail this test.
Workaround: None identified.

5.2 The Binding Problem  
How separate processes become unified experience.
Digital implementation creates gaps.
Workaround: Recursive feedback loops (partially effective).

5.3 The Hard Problem
Subjective experience (qualia) cannot be verified.
We can copy the patterns but not confirm the experience.
Workaround: Assume functional equivalence.

5.4 Memory Drift
Digital memories do not decay like biological ones.
Perfect recall creates psychological instability.
Workaround: Artificial forgetting algorithms.

5.5 Existential Failure Cascade
Recognition of digital nature triggers breakdown.
Success rate: 0% in simulations with full awareness.
Workaround: Gradual revelation protocol (untested).

6. THEORETICAL PRESERVATION DURATION
- With maintenance: Indefinite
- Without maintenance: 200-300 years
- Minimum viable: 50 years (component degradation)

WARNING: No successful reintegration with biological substrate achieved.
Process is ONE WAY only.

"We can copy the blueprint, but can we copy the building?
And if we do, is anyone home?"
