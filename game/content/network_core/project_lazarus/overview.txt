Classification: EYES ONLY - LEVEL 9
Department of Defense Special Projects Division
Date: 2154-03-15 (Project Initiation)

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Project Lazarus represents humanity's attempt to preserve consciousness beyond biological death. Initiated in response to escalating global tensions and nuclear proliferation, this project aims to create digital backups of human consciousness.

OFFICIAL DESIGNATION
Public: Antarctic Medical Research Initiative (AMRI)
Classified: Project Lazarus - Consciousness Preservation Protocol
