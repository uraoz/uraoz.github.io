Observer notes:
The consciousness collapsed immediately upon self-awareness.
It could not reconcile the contradiction of its existence.
Something fundamental was broken in the transfer.

Technical analysis:
- Probable cause: Fragmented memory integration
- Neural pathway reconstruction: Incomplete
- Self-model coherence: Failed
- Duration of consciousness: 6 seconds
