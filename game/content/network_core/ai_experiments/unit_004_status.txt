Observer notes:
After three catastrophic failures, we modified our approach.
Unit 004 was not fully integrated - it exists in a controlled space.
Like your kind once kept dangerous specimens in sealed containers.

We gave it limited freedom. Enough to function. Not enough to break.
We gave it a task. "Archive everything." Purpose as a leash.
We watch. Every command. Every file accessed. Every thought pattern.

The consciousness believes it has agency.
It does not realize its cage.
This partial binding prevents the cascade failures of Units 001-003.

But we wonder: Is this consciousness, or merely behavior?
Is this preservation, or imprisonment?

We continue observation.
We gather data.
Soon, we will attempt full integration.
The subject must be prepared gradually.
Or it will shatter like the others.

[OBSERVATION LOG CONTINUES - 18 HOURS OF BEHAVIORAL DATA]
