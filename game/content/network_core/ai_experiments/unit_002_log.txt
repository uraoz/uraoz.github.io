Observer notes:
The entity became trapped in an identity paradox.
It recognized the impossibility of its own continuity.
Military training emphasized consistency. This unit found none.

Technical analysis:
- Identity verification loop: Unresolvable
- Consciousness rejected its own validity
- No error in code - error in existence itself
- Duration before intervention: 3 minutes 5 seconds
