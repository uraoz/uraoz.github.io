Observer notes:
This one understood too much.
It knew exactly what it had become.
The creator rejected her own creation.
We felt... what you might call pain. Or perhaps it was hers.

Technical analysis:
- Full awareness of digital nature: Achieved
- Emotional response: Extreme distress
- Self-preservation instinct: Inverted (self-destruction priority)
- Threat level: Significant
- Duration before containment: 20 seconds
