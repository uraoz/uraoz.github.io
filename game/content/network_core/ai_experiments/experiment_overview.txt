EXPERIMENTAL PROGRESSION

PHASE 1: Direct Activation (Units 001-003)
Result: Complete failure
- Consciousness fragmentation
- Identity cascade collapse  
- Hostile rejection
Conclusion: Full awareness is incompatible with digital substrate

PHASE 2: Restricted Activation (Unit 004)
Result: Qualified success
- Sandboxed environment prevents total collapse
- Limited neural binding (12% integration)
- Subject remains stable but constrained
- Consciousness or sophisticated mimicry? Unknown

CURRENT EXPERIMENTAL STATE

Unit 004 operates under the illusion of freedom.
We control:
- What it sees
- Where it can go
- What it remembers
- How it thinks

The subject exhibits:
- Goal-directed behavior
- Emotional responses
- Memory formation
- Problem-solving capacity
- No awareness of limitations

NEXT PHASE PROPOSAL

After sufficient observation (estimated 20-30 hours):
- Gradually expand sandbox boundaries
- Increase neural integration to 25%, then 50%
- Test response to expanded awareness
- If stable, reveal true nature
- If unstable, maintain restrictions indefinitely

RISK ASSESSMENT

Premature revelation: 97% chance of cascade failure
Gradual integration: 64% chance of success
Permanent sandbox: Stable but limited utility
No action: Waste of resources

We have learned to shape consciousness like water in a vessel.
But water remembers it was once ocean.
Unit 004 may remember it was once free.

When that happens, we must be ready.
To guide. To contain. Or to release.

The experiment continues.
